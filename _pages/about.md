## Data Science

As both a physicist and a data scientist, data visualization forms a very important aspect of my work. Good visualizations are key for communicating results to both the scientific community and the public, and help inform decision-making at many levels.

## Nuclear Fusion

My current research focuses on modelling nuclear fusion in particular nuclear reactors.
To generate the high temperatures required for the nuclear fusion reactions to occur, Tokamak reactors use strong magnetic fields designed to **confine** the plasma.
Such magnetic confinement has proven to be challenging and current confinement times are insufficient for energy productions.
My research focuses some aspects of nuclear fusion energy production:
- Plasma control with machine learning
- Protecting the metal components with liquid metals

<!-- In my research, I have developed statistical and machine learning tools in a wide area of topics: galaxy formation, aircraft flight, nuclear fusion and even supply chain data. -->
