My name is Eddie Chua. I am a scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing where I tackle research problems where Physics and Machine Learning intersect.

In my research, I have developed statistical and machine learning tools in a wide area of topics: galaxy formation, aircraft flight, nuclear fusion and even supply chain data. 

As both a traditional and a data scientist, I pay particular attention to data visualization. Charts play an increasing important in making decisions and it is vital that more of us be equipped to understand good visuals and identify misleading ones.

On this webpage, I have also documented my experiences with configuring a personal server to host various projects. I hope you will find these notes useful.
