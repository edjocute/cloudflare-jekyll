Welcome! I’m Eddie, a Senior Scientist in A*STAR’s **Future Energy Acceleration and Translation (FEAT)** programme and the **Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC)**.

My work sits at the intersection of physics, machine learning, and high-performance simulation, with a focus on advancing fusion energy. I study how plasmas behave in magnetic-confinement reactors, how materials respond under extreme conditions, and how data-driven approaches can accelerate modelling, diagnostics, and control.

Trained originally as an astrophysicist, I bring that background to understanding complex physical systems and developing predictive computational tools. Today, my research spans both fundamental plasma physics and applied challenges relevant to next-generation fusion reactors.

You can explore my ongoing projects and publications on the [Projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) page.

I also keep notes({% link _pages/posts.md %}) on configuring and operating my personal server—part hobby, part experimental platform for hosting tools and workflows—which may be useful if you’re interested in self-hosted setups.
