Welcome to my page! I'm Eddie, a senior scientist at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) located in Singapore.

Drawing on my graduate training as an astrophysicist, I now tackle research problems at the intersection of Physics and Machine Learning. 
I describe more about my current research [here]({% link _pages/about.md %}) and you can find a list of my current research and published papers on the [Projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) page.


On this [page]({% link _pages/posts.md %}), I have also documented my experiences with configuring a personal server to host various projects and services. I hope you will find these notes useful.
